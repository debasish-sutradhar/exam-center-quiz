    "question": "Employees in the research and development business unit receive extensive training to ensure they understand how to best protect company data. Which of the following is the type of data these employees are most likely to use in day-to-day work activities?",
    "options": ["Encrypted", "Intellectual property", "Critical", "Data in transit"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. Employees in a research and development (R&D) unit are directly involved in creating new products, designs, and inventions, which are the core of a company's IP. This type of data is extremely valuable and requires extensive training to protect against theft or unauthorized disclosure, as it provides a competitive advantage."

    "question": "Which of the following is the best reason to complete an audit in a banking environment?",
    "options": ["Regulatory requirement", "Organizational change", "Self-assessment requirement", "Service-level requirement"],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The banking industry is heavily regulated by government entities to ensure financial stability, protect consumer data, and prevent fraud. Audits in a banking environment are most often driven by regulatory requirements from laws and standards such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). These audits are mandatory to prove compliance and avoid severe financial penalties."

    "question": "Which of the following can best protect against an employee inadvertently installing malware on a company system?",
    "options": ["Host-based firewall", "System isolation", "Least privilege", "Application allow list"],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "An application allow list is a security measure that explicitly defines which applications are permitted to run on a system. All other applications are blocked by default. This is highly effective at preventing employees from installing unauthorized software, including malware, because the malicious program will not be on the pre-approved list and will be blocked from executing."
